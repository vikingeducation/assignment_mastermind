## Game Center Assignment

This week, you'll be building Ruby games on the Command Line for Koding for Kids.  See the [Problem Descriptions](http://vikingcodeschool.com/week-2-ruby/ramping-up-with-oop) and the [Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1158262) for more details.

As always, you will:

1. Fork this repository
2. Code up your solutions to the projects listed in the assignment description and the Pivotal Tracker stories
3. Submit your solutions as a pull request
4. Perform code review on your partner for the week

This is designed as an individual assignment, but feel free to collaborate with your classmates on these problems as much as you'd like.  What matters is that you learn.
