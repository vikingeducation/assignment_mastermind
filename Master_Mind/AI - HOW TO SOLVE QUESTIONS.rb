404 - shift around the 4 definite to find the exacts.
440 - shift around the 4 definite to find the exacts. 
224 - the two definites with one definitely not, and then switch in one of the maybes
008 - 

1. [RED, skin, light blue yellow] {Red = 0 yellow = 4} [ Purple, green, dark blue brown]
- > put definite in next
- > then looked through the history of the others to see where the other definite were sitting, pretty much they only have one spot in the past so just slot it into the next free one. 

2. because the clue board changed from black to white it means that [purple, red, green, light blue] {purple = 0} [skins, dark blue]
- because there are 4 definites we know definitely_not = [skin, dark blue, brown, yellow
- definites first. then put the others all in positions they haven’t been before. 

3. [dark blue yellow cream green][light blue brown purple red] {yellow = 3} []
- exacts first, definite next
- of the maybes, try a combo of maybes that hasn’t been done before and see what happens,
this time it reduced by one 
- tried the next one it’s a direct hit. 

definitely not = dark blue = [0, 2,3] = > so dark blue has to be 1
            cream = [1, 3] => considering green has been in position 3 before and there were two definite and cream has never been in position 0            green = [1, 3]

4. [purple green brown yellow] [red cream] {brown = 3} [dark blue, light blue]
- same size, different color = both definites - one exact 
- 4 definite locked in, forget the rest
- definitely_not for our definites {purple = [0, 3], green = [1, 3], yellow = [3]} = because we know brown is definitely 3
- because in all of our previous ones, brown was the exact that means all the others have never been in an exact position
- the definitely_nots with the biggest sizes because they have less choices, they gotta go first. 
- then place the other one in whatever is left over. 

5. LAST EXAMPLE before I move on [purple, light blue, yellow, brown] [red, dark blue] {purple = 0, yellow = 3, light blue = 1, brown = 2} [skin, green]
1. the size has gone up and one is an exact. conclusion purple is an exact and red is out.
2. nothing has changed, throw both in the maybes
3. size decreased so can conclude dark blue is out and light blue is a definite
4. size has stayed the same but change in color which means yellow is a definite and brown is a definite
5. definite are full so lets move on ! 
6. definitely_nots for our definite that don’t have any exacts = {light blue = [0, 3, 2], brown = [0, 1, 3]}
7. from our previous tests we know light blue can’t be in position 2
8. From the fact that light blue in the definitely_nots has 3 spots taken up, we can conclude light blue = 1
9. From that fact we can confirm that brown can’t be in position 1
10. Now that brown has 3 definitely nots, we can confirm that brown is in position 2

5. ONE LAST ONE [Cream, dark blue, brown, yellow] [Green, light blue] {brown = 3, cream = 0, dark_blue = 1, yellow =2} [red, purple]
1. Switch caused no effect, throw both into maybes
2. Switch caused an increase, throw cream into definites and green into definitely not.
3. Switch caused an increase, throw dark blue into definites and light blue into definitely not. 
4. Switch caused no change in size but there was a color change which means that both are definites and that brown is an exact.
5. Definites maxed out - time to move on by creating a defintely_not for our definites = {cream = 1, 2, 3, dark blue = 0, 2, 3, yellow = 1, 3}
6. Checking out our history, we can say that cream can't be in 1 and dark blue can't be in 2
7. so we're gonna go through our definitely_nots and sort out the biggest sizes first (after placing our definites.)
    put dark blue in cream - dark blue
    and vice versa. put the left over one (yellow in the spare spot)
8. There's been no exacts discovered so put those results into the definitely nots for each one
9. Assess the definitely nots and we can see each one with 3 definitely nots we can put the left over slot as their definite.
10. Which means that there's only slot let for yellow from the definites.
