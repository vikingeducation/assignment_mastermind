who's going to render the board? The game or the board class?

I feel like it's most convenient if the game
asks for a move from the player
  validity would be checked in the form of
    - valid peg chosen?
    - valid destination chosen?
    - if there's a ped there already, make a switch.

Some valid points, for each round there's always going to be 4 Xs somewhere.
Each round however there's going to be a new set of pegs.
