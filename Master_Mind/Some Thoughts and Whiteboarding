Start by thinking through the problem and whiteboarding your solution. Focus on:

Which parts of the program should actually be separate objects (classes) and methods? You can optionally wrap them all in a module.
What variables and methods need to be exposed and which should be private?


Initialise game (Mastermind)
  - Say Hello, Introduce the Game
  - Render board
  - Available pieces
  - Part of the board that shows how close they were to the right answer

  - Once player submits their move around they type s to submit.
  - They can quit at anytime by pressing q. 
  - Should be able to move the pieces from the players rack to the board by being prompted to ask a piece to move from the your set, to a slot on the board. At anytime they can reset the current round. 
  - It would be pretty sick if the user could move a piece back from the board to their rack or if they could switch pieces that are currently on the board.

  Every round you'd need to set up a new coloured 8 pieces.
  Every round you'd need to set up 4 black pieces and 4 white pieces to show once submitted how accurate the player was. 

Sounds like to me you'd need classes wise

Game class
Player class
Pieces class
  with two subclasses
    black and white pieces
    colored pieces
Board class
  with two subclasses
    players board
    clue board
